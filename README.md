Installation
------------

Installing rspec-nc is easy. Just put it in your Gemfile (`gem 'rspec-nc'`) and
run your specs like this from now on:

```
$ rspec --format=doc --format=Nc
```

You will want to specify another formatter as rspec-nc does not provide any
other output.

If you want to use rspec-nc as your default formatter, simply put this option
in your .rspec file:

```
--format Nc
```

Installation
------------

This gem currently supports rspec ~> 2.9 (meaning 2.9 - 2.14, not 2.99 or 3.0).
